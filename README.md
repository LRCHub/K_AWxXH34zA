```
No eyes on me
Oh, you used to look at me back then
Tryna control every step that I was takin'
But I know what I won't be missin'
And it won't be you listening
Baby, I'm over you
Used to think you're all I need
Now you're gone, I'm feeling free
I don't need your eyes on me
Eyes on me
Eyes on me
Pour it up, the drink's on me
I don't want no sympathy
I don't need no eyes on me
Eyes on me
No eyes on me
No eyes on me
I don't want no, I don't want, don't want, no
Oh yeah, getting over you
Baby, getting under with someone else
That I don't know tonight
Oh, hell yeah
I'ma do my thing anywhere
Making vsure that I'll get there
Without you by my side
Used to think you're all I need
Now you're gone, I'm feeling free
I don't need your eyes on me
Eyes on me
Eyes on me
Pour it up, the drink's on me
I don't want no sympathy
I don't need no eyes on me
Eyes on me
No eyes on me
No eyes on me
No eyes on me
I don't want to, I don't want, don't want, no
No eyes on me
I don't want to, I don't want, don't want, no
No eyes on me
Ooh, no eyes on me
Oh yeah
Pour it up, the drink's on me
I don't want no sympathy
I don't need your eyes on me
Eyes on me
No eyes on me
I don't need no, I don't need no
(So pour it up)
No eyes on me
(So pour it up)
No eyes on me
I don't need no, I don't need no
(So pour it up)
No Eyes on me
I don't want no, I don't want, don't want, no
No eyes on me
I don't want no eyes on me, no eyes on me
No eyes on me
(Pour it up)
No eyes on me
